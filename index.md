### Biography

I'm currently a research fellow at School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering(EEE) in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by Prof. Wen Bihan.
Previously, I received my D.Eng. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) supervised by Prof. Yongtian Wang in 2021.
I received my B.Eng. degree in Department of Precision Instrument at Tsinghua University in 2015. I have also been a research intern at SenseTime from 2018 to 2020.

### Research Insterest

My research interest lies at the intersection of Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. In particular, my work focuses on stereo vision, image/video restoration, and high-speed video reconstruction with event cameras.
