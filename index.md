### Biography

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at SOP in Beijing Institute of Technology, China, supervised by Prof. Yongtian Wang.
Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree in Department of Precision Instrument at Tsinghua University in 2015. I have also been a research intern at SenseTime from 2018 to 2020.

### Research Insterest

My research interest lies at the intersection of Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. In particular, my work focuses on stereo vision, image/video restoration, and high-speed video reconstruction with event cameras.
